I created this code while doing an assignment in my Satellite & Radar course at the University of Florida. The code is meant to take NEXRAD data from the New Orleans radar (KLIX) and mesh it with IMERG data. From this I was able to make scatterplots to determine the relationship between the KLIX and IMERG precipitation data.
