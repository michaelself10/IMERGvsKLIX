I created this code while doing an assignment in my Satellite & Radar course at the University of Florida. The code is meant to take NEXRAD data from the New Orleans radar (KLIX) and mesh it with IMERG data. From this I was able to make scatterplots to determine the relationship between the KLIX and IMERG precipitation data.

Disclaimer: I taught python to myself the same semester as this lab so most of the code is not the most efficient but it does work. More work to come... and it'll be better.
